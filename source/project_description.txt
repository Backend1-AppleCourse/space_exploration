space exploration
Topics:
● functions
● modules
Task description:
● Embark on a space adventure, navigating a spacecraft
through cosmic challenges.
Requirements:
Modules and Packages:
● Utilize the following modules/packages in your game:
● random: For generating random events.
● time: For simulating time delays in the game.
● math: For calculations (e.g., fuel efficiency).
● json: For saving and loading game data.
● requests: For making HTTP requests (simulated for
fetching galactic weather). use a weather api. you
can use other types of api if you want.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
● Implement a class named Spaceship to represent the
player's spacecraft. Include attributes such as name,
fuel, and health.
● Ensure the Spaceship class has a __str__ method to
provide a string representation.
Game Logic:
● Implement a space exploration game where the player
controls a spaceship.
● Include random events such as "Asteroid Field," "Space
Pirates," "Alien Diplomacy," and "Black Hole."
Functions:
● Create functions for different tasks, such as launching
the spacecraft, exploring the galaxy, and handling space
events.
● Encapsulate specific functionalities within functions to
maintain a modular code structure.
Conditions and Decision-Making:
● Use conditional statements to handle different scenarios
during the game.
● Implement decision-making logic based on random
events, player choices, or external factors.
● for example: if you are encountering an asteroid field,
you can evade or fire at the asteroids. make each
decision have consequences.
External Data Interaction:
● Simulate interaction with an external API using the
requests package. Fetch information like the current
weather in a distant galaxy.
Persistence:
● Implement a mechanism for saving and loading game
data using the json module.
● Save essential information such as the spaceship's
name, fuel, and health.
